# microblog-service

Small microblogging service for my website created to explore AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway.

This repo contains the source code for both Lambda functions, as well as a small cli client for making authenticated POST requests to the API Gateway endpoint.

The production blog can be found behind a hidden /blog route on my site [here](https://leyland.dev/blog).
